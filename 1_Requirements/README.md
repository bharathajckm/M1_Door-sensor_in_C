## Introduction 
The Repositirory  gives the tutorial for programming of Atmega328p I/O ports, Basic input and output configuration of the pin is shown. The door sensor problem statement is cover to explain pin monitoring. masking concept is used to not affect the status of other pins. Simulation of the circuit and code is shown in simulide.
### Objective
The goal of this project is to know whether to open or close the door, it will sense when door is closed the led light will didn't glow but when door is open the led light will glow.

### Benefits
Helps to know whether the door is opened or closed.

## Cost and Features
The cost for implementing a project invloving a Door sensor using atmegz328 is minimal none. And the features are:
1. Safety whether the door is closed or open
2. Easy to simulate in simulide
3. Code is debug in the microchip studio.

### Defining Our System
In this project I have us the ATmega328

| Description| 8-bit AVR Microcontrollers                                                          |
| Feature    | No. of Pins-28,CPU-RISC 8-Bit AVR,Operating Voltage-1.8 to 5.5V,Program Memory-32KB |

The goal of this project is to know whether to open or close the door, 
it will sense when door is closed the led light will didn't glow but when door is open the led light will glow.
Simulation of the circuit is shown in simulide.
The code is executed in the Microchip studio and Makefile and Hexfile is generated in the Microchip studio
